                In the cosmic tapestry of space, few creatures are as cool as the Blocky Space Boy. Discovered in the vast, warm waters of the outer space oceans of celestial lasagna, these creatures have carved out a niche in an environment that is as harsh as it is beautiful. The discovery itself was accidental, a byproduct of Dr. Garfield's exploration into cosmic culinary experiences, which led him to a realm beyond the confines of traditional physics and biology. Blocky Space Boys, while named with the world ‚ÄúBoy,‚Äù by Dr. Garfield, are actually hermaphroditic.

                Blocky Space Boys are known to reside in areas densely populated with space worms. Their homes are crafted from the blocks that litter this outer space cryptic ocean, define structure in an otherwise dark emptiness.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> These creatures show highly antisocial behaviors, with avoidance of other living creatures (other than space worms) being an apparent hobby. Given the creatures unqiue abilities it also avoids electric signals, with a high level of intellegence allowing it to interpret digital signals. Through a still unknown process, these Blocky Space Boys are somehow aware when they're being observed, hiding from mouse locations on computer screens.
