                <p>Deep in the warm waters of the outer space ocean, blocks shape a rounded habitat. Blocky Space Boys often live around spcae worms and feed off the their excrement.</p>

                <p>With a reflective bioflurencence due to its unique appetite, the species generally appear with a glowing blue primary color, which is contrasted by white features. Given their strange existence, they leave glowing trail in time, reflecting unqiue cosmic features.</p>

                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your creature.)
